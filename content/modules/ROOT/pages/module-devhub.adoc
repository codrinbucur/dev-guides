== Goals of this lab

*Parasol* is standardizing on an *internal developer portal (IDP)* for its developers to use to build, deploy, and manage cloud native applications, including those with AI capabilities. In this exercise, you will learn how to harness the power of the Parasol internal developer portal to streamline and enhance your development workflow for AI apps. This exercise will guide you through creating a new application using a software template, observing the automatic CI/CD processes powered by Tekton and Argo, and using your web-based IDE, Red Hat Dev Spaces. You'll create a new branch to develop and add an AI feature, in this case an email generator. After merging your pull request, you'll monitor the deployment process via OpenShift GitOps in the Red Hat Dev Hub dashboard. Finally, you'll verify the functionality of your new application by accessing its frontend page. This hands-on experience will empower you to efficiently utilize the Parasol developer portal for seamless application development and deployment.

== Add a new generative AI feature

Now you'll use the Dev Spaces to develop a new Generative AI feature, an email generator for responding to customer queries via email.

=== Create a new Gen AI email service

You'll create a new Java AI service that generates emails based on https://developers.redhat.com/products/quarkus/overview[Quarkus^] and the https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j[LangChain4j^] library. The https://quarkus.io/extensions/?search-regex=langchain[Quarkus LangChain4j extensions^] bridge the gap between your Quarkus application and LangChain4j, a library that allows interaction with various LLMs like OpenAI, Hugging Face models, or Ollama, with the following key features and benefits:

* *Key Features*
** *Declarative AI Services*: Define how you want to interact with the LLM using annotations or configuration files.
** *Embedding Support*: Integrates with document embedding stores like Redis, Chroma, or Infinispan to store and retrieve document context for the LLM.
** *Observability Integration*: Allows monitoring and logging of LLM interactions within your Quarkus application.
** *Pluggable Authentication*: Supports different authentication providers for accessing LLM services.

* *Benefits*
** *Simplified LLM Integration*: The extension streamlines the process of incorporating LLMs into your application, saving development time and effort.
** *Declarative Approach*: It offers a declarative way to interact with LLMs, making the code more readable and maintainable. You specify what you want the LLM to do, and the extension handles the underlying communication.
** *Embedding Support*: Supports Diverse LLMs: The extension is designed to work with a variety of LLM providers, giving you flexibility in choosing the LLM that best suits your needs.

==== Create a new branch in Gitlab

Open a Terminal window in the VS Code workspace.

image::devhub/new-terminal.png[new-terminal, 500]

Before you begin developing your new feature, you need to create a new branch in Gitlab called `new-gen-ai-service`. Open a terminal in the VS Code workspace. Run the following `git` command to create the new branch.

[.console-input]
[source,shell,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
git checkout -b new-gen-ai-service
----

==== Get started with live coding

Before you start coding, you need to start with the *Quarkus Dev Mode* that is a powerful feature to significantly speed up the development lifecycle of Quarkus applications. It provides hot reload capabilitiesn (Live Coding), allowing you to see the results of your code changes instantly without requiring a full application restart.

Run the following command in the VS Code terminal to start Quarkus Dev Mode.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
./mvnw clean quarkus:dev
----

The output should look similar to the following (wait for the ASCII art!):

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----

Validate your local Parasol application against the production version by accessing the https://{user}-parasol-insurance-parasol-webui.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[Parasol web page^] (it may take up to a minute to come up - wait for the "Listening on..." message as shown above).

image::devhub/parasol_ui_web.png[]

==== Preview the changes you need to make

To add the new feature, you will either create or edit the following files. Use this list as a checklist to ensure you've made all the changes. If you get errors when you try to run the app, be sure each file was changed as described in the instructions below!

* `src/main/java/org/parasol/model/Email.java` - A Java record defining an incoming email from a customer
* `src/main/java/org/parasol/model/EmailResponse.java` - A Java record defining a response (subject+message)
* `src/main/java/org/parasol/ai/EmailService.java` - interface for interacting with the underlying LLM
* `src/main/java/org/parasol/resources/EmailResource.java` - A REST-like web frontend interface
* `src/main/resources/application.properties` - The Quarkus configuration where you'll define the parameters for connecting to the LLM inference service
* `src/main/webui/src/app/components/EmailGenerate/EmailGenerate.tsx` - A React web component providing a simple interface for providing a customer email
* `src/main/webui/src/app/routes.tsx` - A list of React routes to which you'll add the new Email generator component

==== Create Java records beans

Create a new Java record, `Email.java` in the `src/main/java/org/parasol/model` folder to carry email data in a concise and immutable way.

To create this file, right-click on the `model` folder in the file tree, then select "New File..." and enter the name of the new file `Email.java`. The empty file will open.

image::devhub/new-file.png[new-file, 500]

Copy the following code and paste it into the content editor.

[.console-input]
[source,java,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
package org.parasol.model;

public record Email(String text) { }
----

[NOTE]
====
Where is the Save button? VS Code will autosave your changes, that is why you can’t find a SAVE button - no more losing code because you forgot to save. You can undo with *CTRL-Z* (or *CMD-Z* on a Mac) or by using the `Edit -> Undo` menu option.
====

Next, create a new Java record, `EmailResponse.java` in the `src/main/java/org/parasol/model` folder to store the response from the LLM. Copy the following code and paste it into the `EmailResponse.java` file.

[.console-input]
[source,java,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
package org.parasol.model;

public record EmailResponse(String subject, String message) { }
----

==== Create Java AI service

Create a new Java file, `EmailService.java` in the `src/main/java/org/parasol/ai` folder to serve as the AI Service connection point between your application and the LLM. Copy the following code and paste it into the `EmailService.java` file.

[.console-input]
[source,java,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
package org.parasol.ai;

import org.parasol.model.EmailResponse;

import dev.langchain4j.service.SystemMessage;
import dev.langchain4j.service.UserMessage;
import io.quarkiverse.langchain4j.RegisterAiService;

@RegisterAiService(modelName = "parasol-email")<1>
public interface EmailService {
    @SystemMessage("""<2>
      You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant named "Parasol Assistant".

      You are responding to customer emails. Provide a friendly response that is written by Parasol. The response should thank them for being a customer. Include information about when parasol insurance was founded.

      Your response must look like the following JSON:

      {
        "subject": [A good one-line greeting],
        "message": [Your response, summarizing the information they gave and ask the customer for any follow-up information needed to file a claim]
      }
      """)
    EmailResponse chat(@UserMessage String claim);<3>
}
----
<1> `@RegisterAiService` annotation is pivotal for registering the AI Service, represented as a Java interface.
<2> `@SystemMessage` annotation defines the scope and initial instructions, serving as the first message sent to the LLM. It delineates the AI service's role in the interaction.
<3> `@UserMessage` annotation defines primary instructions dispatched to the LLM. It typically encompasses requests and the expected response format.

==== Create Jakarta REST resource

Create a new Java file, `EmailResource.java` in the `src/main/java/org/parasol/resources` folder to serve a new REST endpoint. Copy the following code and paste it into the `EmailResource.java` file.

[.console-input]
[source,java,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
package org.parasol.resources;

import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Consumes;
import jakarta.ws.rs.POST;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
import jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

import org.parasol.ai.EmailService;
import org.parasol.model.Email;
import org.parasol.model.EmailResponse;

@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Path("/api/email") // <1>
public class EmailResource {

    @Inject
    EmailService bot;

    @POST
    @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public EmailResponse getresponse(Email claimEmail) {
        return bot.chat(claimEmail.text());
    }
}
----
<1> *@Path* annotation defines the URL path for the resource.

==== Add new LLM model configurations

Open the existing `application.properties` file in the `src/main/resources` folder to append the following Langchain4j configuration values.

[.console-input]
[source,properties,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
quarkus.langchain4j.parasol-email.chat-model.provider=openai<1>
quarkus.langchain4j.openai.parasol-email.chat-model.temperature=0.3<2>
quarkus.langchain4j.openai.parasol-email.timeout=600s<3>
quarkus.langchain4j.openai.parasol-email.chat-model.model-name=parasol-instruct<4>
quarkus.langchain4j.openai.parasol-email.base-url=http://parasol-instruct-predictor.aiworkshop.svc.cluster.local:8080/v1<5>
----
<1> Specify the model provider (e.g., openai, huggingface). Note that you use the Open AI API specification when you connect to the LLM (parasol-instruct) inference endpoint
<2> Set the model temperature. Temperature is a parameter used in natural language processing models to increase or decrease the “confidence” a model has in its most likely response
<3> Specify the timeout between question and response in the LLM
<4> Specify the model name to connect to
<5> Specify the base URL of the LLM inference endpoint that the application will connect to


=== Update the frontend web application in Parasol Insurance

Let's update the frontend React web application to give our customer service reps a nice interface for generating emails.

==== Create new React TypeScript component

Create a new `EmailGenerate` folder in the `src/main/webui/src/app/components` folder. Also, create a new TypeScript XML file, `EmailGenerate.tsx` in the `src/main/webui/src/app/components/EmailGenerate` folder to render the output of the LLM in the email subject and body content. Copy the following code and paste it into the EmailGenerate.tsx file.

[.console-input]
[source,javascript,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
import config from '@app/config';
import { Button, Form, FormGroup, TextArea, Spinner } from '@patternfly/react-core';
import * as React from 'react';
import { useState } from 'react';

interface ResponseData {
    subject: string;
    message: string;
  }

const EmailGenerate: React.FunctionComponent = () => {

    const [text, setText] = useState('');
    const [error, setError] = useState('');
    const [response, setResponse] = useState<ResponseData | null>(null);
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

    const handleSubmit = async (event: React.FormEvent) => {
      event.preventDefault();
      setLoading(true);

      try {
        const response = await fetch('/api/email', {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
          },
          body: JSON.stringify({ text: text })
        });
        console.log("response: ");
        console.log(response);
        if (response.ok) {
          const data = await response.json();
          setResponse(data);
          setError('');
        } else {
          setError('Error: Failed to fetch response from server.');
        }
      } catch (error) {
        setError('Error!');
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }

    };

    return (
        <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', height: '100vh' }}>

        <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit} style={{ width: '800px', textAlign: 'center' }}>
        <FormGroup label="Your Feedback" fieldId="text-area">
          <TextArea
            onChange={(value) => setText(value.target.value)}
            name="textArea"
            id="text-area"
            aria-label="Your feedback"
            placeholder="Enter customer email content here"
            style={{ width: '100%' }}
          />
        </FormGroup>
        <Button type="submit">Submit</Button>
        {loading && <Spinner style={{justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center'}} size="lg" />}
        {response && (
          <div id="email-response" style={{ marginTop: '20px', color: 'blue', textAlign: 'left', width: '100%' }}>
            <div id="email-response-subject" style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', fontFamily: 'Arial' }}>Subject: {response.subject}</div>
            <pre id="email-response-message" style={{ whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap', wordWrap: 'break-word', fontFamily: 'monospace', border: '1px solid black', padding: '10px' }}>
              {response.message}
            </pre>
          </div>
        )}

        {error && (
            <div style={{ marginTop: '20px', color: 'red', textAlign: 'left', width: '100%' }}>{error}</div>
        )}

      </Form>
    </div>

    )
}

export { EmailGenerate };
----

This interface allows customer service representatives to copy and paste the customer email into the box, and then it generates a response email. That's the feature you are adding here.

==== Add a new menu item in the navigation bar

Open the `routes.tsx` file in the `src/main/webui/src/app` folder and `uncomment` the following code out in line *8* and *89 - 95* to show the new menu item.

[NOTE]
====
For example, press kbd:[Ctrl+/] on Windows or kbd:[Cmd+/] on macOS to comment out the code.
====

[.console-output]
[source,javascript]
----
import { EmailGenerate } from './components/EmailGenerate/EmailGenerate';
----

[.console-output]
[source,javascript]
----
{
  component: EmailGenerate,
  exact: true,
  label: 'Email Generate',
  path: '/EmailGenerate',
  title: 'Email Generate'
},
----

==== Local test the new feature

Before committing, do a quick functional test locally to ensure you got all the changes correct. If you stopped the Quarkus dev mode, start it again.

Reload the https://{user}-parasol-insurance-parasol-webui.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[Parasol web page^].

[NOTE]
====
If you're still seeing the old page, try refreshing the page without the browser caches by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+F5] or kbd:[Cmd+Shift+R] on macOS.
====

The new *Email Generate* menu item will appear on the left panel. Click on it.

Try to submit a simple draft email content. Copy/paste in the following email received from a customer:

[.console-input]
[source,text,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
    Dear Parasol Insurance Team,

    My name is Dominic Toretto.

    I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to file a claim regarding a recent incident involving my car, which is covered under my policy with Parasol. The accident occurred last night on the streets of Los Angeles, and I wanted to provide you with all the necessary details.

    Location: The accident took place at the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street in downtown Los Angeles. It was one of those crazy nights, where the streets were alive with the sound of engines and the glow of neon lights.

    Circumstances: So, here's the deal. I was out cruising with the crew, enjoying the vibe of the city, when suddenly we found ourselves in the middle of a high-speed chase. There was this dude, let's call him Johnny Tran for the sake of this email, who thought he could outmaneuver us. Little did he know, we don't play by the rules.

    Anyway, Johnny pulled some slick moves, cutting through traffic like a bat outta hell. Naturally, being the king of the streets that I am, I had to show him what real speed looks like. So, I hit the nitrous and went full throttle.

    But then, outta nowhere, this semi-truck decided to make a left turn without signaling. I had to make a split-second decision, and I ended up launching my car off a ramp, trying to clear the truck like we're in one of those crazy action flicks. It was like something straight outta the movies, I tell ya.

    Long story short, the stunt didn't exactly go as planned. My car ended up crashing into a billboard, flipping over a couple of times before finally coming to a stop. Yeah, it was a total wreck. But hey, at least we walked away without a scratch, just a little shaken, not stirred, if you catch my drift.

    Damage: As for the damage to my car, let's just say its gonna need more than a few wrenches and some duct tape to fix this baby up. The front end is smashed in, the windows are shattered, and I''m pretty sure the chassis is twisted beyond recognition. It''s gonna take a miracle to get her back on the road.

    I understand that accidents happen, but Im counting on Parasol to have my back in times like these. Ive been a loyal customer for years, and I trust that you'll handle my claim with the same speed and precision that I handle my rides.

    Please let me know what steps I need to take to get the ball rolling on this claim. I'm ready to do whatever it takes to get my car back in top shape and back on the streets where it belongs.

    Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
