== Goals of this lab

*Parasol* is standardizing on an *internal developer portal (IDP)* for its developers to use to build, deploy, and manage cloud native applications, including those with AI capabilities. In this exercise, you will learn how to harness the power of the Parasol internal developer portal to streamline and enhance your development workflow for AI apps. This exercise will guide you through creating a new application using a software template, observing the automatic CI/CD processes powered by Tekton and Argo, and using your web-based IDE, Red Hat Dev Spaces. You'll create a new branch to develop and add an AI feature, such as an email generator. After merging your pull request, you'll monitor the deployment process via OpenShift GitOps in the Red Hat Dev Hub dashboard. Finally, you'll verify the functionality of your new application by accessing its frontend page. This hands-on experience will empower you to efficiently utilize the Parasol developer portal for seamless application development and deployment.

== 1. Deploy the existing Parasol applications in Red Hat Developer Hub

https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-developer-hub[Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)^] is an enterprise-grade, self-managed, and customizable *developer portal* built on top of https://backstage.io/[Backstage.io^]. It's designed to streamline the development process for organizations, specifically those using Red Hat products and services. Here's a breakdown of its key Benefits:

* *Increased Developer Productivity*: Reduces time spent searching for resources and setting up environments.
* *Improved Collaboration*: Provides a central platform for developers to share knowledge and best practices.
* *Reduced Cognitive Load*: Minimizes the need for developers to juggle multiple tools and resources.
* *Enterprise-Grade Support*: Backed by Red Hat's support infrastructure, ensuring stability and reliability.

Red Hat Developer Hub has already been installed and configured in the workshop environment.

=== 1.1. Access Red Hat Developer Hub

Red Hat Developer Hub can integrate with https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on/[Red Hat Single Sign On (RH-SSO)^] to enhance security and user experience for developers within an organization. By integrating with RH-SSO, developers only need to log in once to access both RHDH and other applications secured by RH-SSO. This eliminates the need to manage multiple login credentials for different developer tools and services. RH-SSO can centralize user authentication and authorization to strengthen security by ensuring only authorized users can access RHDH and other protected resources. In addition, The platform engineer team can manage user access and permissions centrally through RH-SSO, simplifying administration and reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

To get started, *access* https://developer-hub-backstage-globex-devhub.{openshift_subdomain}[Red Hat Developer Hub Dashboard^] with the following credential:

* *Username*: 

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
{user}
----

* *Password*: 

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
{password}

=== 1.2. Create a Parasol LLM software template

In Red Hat Developer Hub, a software template serves as a pre-configured blueprint for creating development environments and infrastructure. Here's a closer look at software templates in Dev Hub. Software templates streamline the process of setting up development environments by encapsulating pre-defined configurations. This saves developers time and effort compared to manually configuring everything from scratch.

Click on `Create...` on the left menu. Then, select the `Parasol LLM` template.

image::devhub/software_template_parasol_llm.png[software_template_parasol_llm, 600]  

Follow the next steps to create a component based on the pre-defined Software Templates:

==== 1.2.1. Provide information about the Gitlab location

* *Repo Host*: is the Gitlab domain already installed in OpenShift. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data to upload the source repository and manifests.

** Replace the *Repo Host* with the OpenShift domain: 

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
Gitlab-Gitlab.{openshift_subdomain}
----

image::devhub/st_Gitlab_info.png[st_Gitlab_info, 800]  

* *Repo Group*: is the Gitlab organization already configured. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data to upload the source repository and manifests.

* Click on *Next*

==== 1.2.2. Provide information about the cluster Id:

* *Cluster Id*: is the OpenShift domain. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data to build and deploy the application.

** Replace the *Cluster Id* with the OpenShift domain: 

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
.{openshift_subdomain}
----

image::devhub/st_component_clusterid.png[st_component_clusterid, 800]  

* *Namespace*:  is the OpenShift namespace. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data to build and deploy the application in that namespace.

** Replace the *N* with the user number:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
globex-devhub-{user}
----

image::devhub/st_component_namespace.png[st_component_namespace, 800]  

*Note*: Each lab participant is already assigned a unique namespace to be used for all the applications. Each application will have a shared identification based on your user name. 

* *Owner*: The owner is your user ID. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data in the build and deployment process.
** Write your user id: 

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
qa-{user}
----

image::devhub/st_component_owner.png[st_component_owner, 800]  

* Click on *Next*

==== 1.2.3. Provide build information:

* *Image Host*: The application image will be stored in this registry URL. For this lab, we are using the internal registry of OpenShift. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data for the application build and deployment process.

* *Image Tag*: The image tag used to identify the image. The image will be composed by the application name and tag. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data for the application build and deployment process.

* *Component ID*: The component ID is the application name. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data for the application build and deployment process.

** Replace the *Component ID* using *YOUR* user number: 

[.console-input]
