==== Play with the AI chatbot

As a Parasol customer service representative, try to ask any questions about the claim to the AI chatbot. For example, you can ask if the policy is still covered or not for this car incident.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
Please clarify the policy coverage for this specific claim.
----

Then, click on `paper airplane` icon to send the query. The AI chatbot will connect to the trained Parasol LLM and respond with an answer.

[NOTE]
====
If nothing happens when you click the paper airplane icon, please refresh the page and try again.

You will see the answer in a few seconds. The answer provided may differ from what is shown below, but in general it should include Parasol-specific policy requirements from the data that was used to train the model.
