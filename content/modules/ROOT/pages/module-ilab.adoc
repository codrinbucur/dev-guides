== Goals of this lab

Need to add the goals here.

== Adapting AI Models for an Enterprise Use Case

As Parasol Insurance embraces the era of AI, we face a unique challenge: leveraging cutting-edge AI technology while maintaining strict control over our proprietary data and processes. This journey requires us to develop in-house AI capabilities that are as powerful as they are secure. In this exercise, you will:

* Explore *fine-tuning* techniques for AI models, incorporating Parasol's unique insurance expertise into LLMs
* Learn how to create and utilize a *custom knowledge base* for training AI models with organization-specific scenarios and regulations
* Apply the https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01081[*LAB methodology*] to generate synthetic training data and specialize our model while keeping data in-house
* Gain hands-on experience in *training and serving* a customized AI model
* Understand the *benefits and limitations* of fine-tuning compared to other AI customization methods

// image::instructlab/parasol-ai-journey.png[Parasol's Private AI Journey]

// === Enterprise Needs for an AI Model

// This lab will equip you to enhance Parasol's AI capabilities in three key areas:

// 1. Generating product-specific email templates
// 2. Providing comprehensive policy and product information
// 3. Offering insights on relevant local regulations

// Through fine-tuning, you'll learn how to provide an LLM accurate and relevant information to provide more efficient, accurate, and compliant customer service.

=== Enhancing AI Models: RAG vs Fine-Tuning

When customizing AI models, two techniques stand out: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning.

* *Fine-tuning* excels when you need precise, controlled outputs for specialized tasks using curated data. It's ideal for applications where security and compliance require embedding all data within the model. Fine-tuning is also suitable when you have clear use cases with specific task requirements.

image::ilab/rag-vs-finetuning-1.png[RAG vs Fine-Tuning]

* In contrast, *Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)* is best when you need real-time access to dynamic knowledge bases, especially in environments with constantly updating information. RAG allows for scalability and handles out-of-domain queries effectively without the need for retraining, making it quick solution for improving model output. However, by providing contextual information to the model for each prompt, your expenses and computer resources may be higher than "baking-in" information into the model through fine-tuning.

image::ilab/rag-vs-finetuning-2.png[RAG vs Fine-Tuning]

== Get Started with Fine-Tuning

Now that we've outlined Parasol's AI needs, let's dive into the process of meeting them. In this section, we'll explore how to use the InstructLab project to tailor a foundation language model to Parasol's specific requirements, focusing on the key areas we've identified.

=== What is InstructLab?

https://instructlab.ai/[InstructLab] is an open-source project designed to enhance large language models (LLMs) for use in generative AI applications. It provides a novel approach to model alignment and fine-tuning, allowing developers and domain experts to add new knowledge and skills to pre-trained models with minimal data and computational resources. Key features of InstructLab include:

* A taxonomy-driven approach to curating training data
* Large-scale synthetic data generation
* Iterative alignment tuning for continuous model improvement

image::ilab/instructlab-components.png[InstructLab Overview]

InstructLab is particularly useful for organizations that want to leverage private AI and keep their data in-house while still benefiting from state-of-the-art language models, without needing AI/ML or data science expertise.

As you work with InstructLab, you will see the terms _Skills_ and _Knowledge_. What is the difference between Skills and Knowledge? A simple analogy is to think of a skill as teaching someone how to fish. Knowledge, on the other hand, is knowing that the best place to catch a Bass is when the sun is setting while casting your line near the trunk of a tree along the bank.

=== Access your Virtual Environment

To begin working with InstructLab, you'll need to access the provided noNVC virtual environment. This environment comes pre-configured with all necessary tools and dependencies: {novnc_url}[*{novnc_url}*,window=_blank], using the password `{password}`.

== Model Fine-Tuning for the Insurance Organization

In the next few sections, we'll walk through the process of fine-tuning an AI model using InstructLab. We'll start by setting up our environment, generating synthetic training data, training the model, and then interacting with it. We will build upon that and delve further into the biggest insurance company in North America, Parasol, which has the most extensive customer base. Parasol Insurance gets many requests to process claims, questions about different products, etc. These requests are not just internal but also external.

Parasol Insurance's primary concern is ensuring that its staff is capable of handling such requests and has access to this information through a single interface rather than going through multiple systems to scrape documents and internal portal pages. To this end, you have been tasked with adding knowledge that will aid the following use cases.

. Products and coverage (ex. providing comprehensive policy and product information)
. Basic knowledge of the Insurance rules (ex. offering insights on relevant local regulations)
. Responses to general claim questions and remedies (ex. generating product-specific email templates)

image::ilab/parasol-insurance-chat.png[Parasol Insurance]

=== Preparing the Parasol Insurance Knowledge Base

The approach of fine-tuning a model allows us to shape a language model to better understand a specific domain, and fill in the gaps in its knowledge. The InstructLab taxonomy provides a structured way to guide the model fine-tuning process, enabling us to add domain-specific knowledge to the model in a heirarchical manner, similar to the example below:

image::ilab/instructlab-taxonomy.png[InstructLab Taxonomy]

Your role is crucial in this process. You'll be adding a knowledge domain to the LLM, using the organization's specific information, knowledge that the LLM doesn't have and is specific to Parasol Insurance. 

=== Understanding the Knowledge Structure

Knowledge consists of data and facts and is backed by documents. When you create knowledge for a model, you're giving it additional data to more accurately answer questions. Knowledge contributions in this project contain a few things:

* A file in a https://github.com/rh-rad-ai-roadshow/parasol_knowledge[Git repository] that holds your information. For example, these repositories can include markdown versions of information on: Parasol products, insurance domain knowledge, claims processing etc.
* A `qna.yaml` file that asks and answers questions about the information in the git repository, with desirable responses.
* An `attribution.txt` that includes the sources for the information used in the `qna.yaml`, which aids in transparency and accountability.

LLMs have inherent limitations that make certain tasks extremely difficult, like doing math problems. They're great at other tasks, like creative writing. And they could be better at things like logical reasoning. However, these limitations can be overcome by providing them with the right knowledge (and skills, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kbq-npuMC0[which InstructLab can also help with]). An LLM with knowledge helps it create a basis of information that it can learn from, then you can teach it to use this knowledge via the `qna.yaml` files.

In our case we want the LLM to learn more about Parasol Insurance like so:

[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
version: 2<1>
task_description: "Teach a model more details about Parasol Insurance"<2>
created_by: sshaaf<3>
domain: insurance<4>
seed_examples:<5>
  - question: What is class imbalance in the context of Parasol insurance claims datasets?
    answer: |
      Class imbalance refers to the situation where the number of non-claims instances far exceeds that of actual claims, posing challenges for predictive modeling.

document:<6>
  repo: https://github.com/sshaaf/parasol_knowledge.git
  commit: b87677d
  patterns: <7>
    - Insurance_claims_data.md
----

Each `qna.yaml` file requires a minimum of five question-answer pairs. The `qna.yaml` format must include the following fields:

<1> `version`: Defines the InstructLab taxonomy schema version
<2> `task_description`: An optional description of the knowledge for easily understanding the specific knowledge contribution
<3> `created_by`: The author of the contribution, typically a GitHub username
<4> `domain`: Category of the knowledge
<5> `seed_examples`: Five or more examples sourced from the provided knowledge documents, representing a `question` for the model and desired `response`
<6> `document`: The source of your knowledge contribution, consisting of a `repo` URL pointing to the knowlege markdown files, and `commit` SHA that contains the specific files
<7> `patterns`: A list of glob patterns specifying the markdown files in your repository. Any glob pattern that starts with `*`, such as `*.md`, must be quoted due to YAML rules. For example, `"*.md"`. In our case we have placed all the knowledge documents in the https://github.com/rh-rad-ai-roadshow/parasol_knowledge[parasol-knoledge] repository.

=== Creating the Parasol Insurance Knowledge Base

Now that we understand the constructs of the taxonomy's knowledge, let's go ahead and create our knowledge base, which we will then feed into the LLM to train. This will help our applications that utilize the LLM, and agents directly chatting with the model. Furthermore, it will help with claims processing, fraud detection, or anyone who would like to ask the LLM about products, coverage, laws, and some information about Parasol itself. Let's get started! 

You can open VSCode by following the instructions below:

. Open the `instructlab` directory in Visual Studio Code through the terminal:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
cd ~/instructlab && code . --reuse-window
----

[start=2]
. With the new window open, you can select *Yes, I trust the authors* to proceed. You'll be prompted to enter your password, `{password}`, to confirm the action.

image::ilab/vscode-trust-authors.png[Trust Authors]

[start=3]
. Navigate to the `taxonomy/knowledge/` folder  . This file will contain the questions and answers that will be used to train the model.

[start=4]
. Lets create a structure for Parasol insurance knowledge. To do that create folders by first right clicking on the `Knowledge` folder, and then pressing `New Folder`, as shown in the screen shot below

image::ilab/ilab-taxanomy-create-folder.png[New Folder]

We should create a knowledge folder structure that we can add to later as we add more knowledge and for our peers to also understand how its structured. Lets create a structure like this `knowledge > economy > finance > insurance`. In VSCode this is quite easy. 

[start=5]
. In the field as shown in the image below type `economy/finance/insurance`

image::ilab/ilab-taxonomy-create-folder2.png[New folder]

Perfect, now we have the basic working structure to add in specific knowledge about our organization.

== Curating the Data for our AI Model

Let’s now start adding the following taxonomy knowledge files for Parasol Insurance, consisting of the following (you can expand each section to see the instructions):

=== Knowledge File #1: Driving Age

[%collapsible]

=== Knowledge File #2: Parasol Claims Data
// - **Parasol claims data**
[%collapsible]
====
Like any insurance company on the planet, data is stored into multiple systems, files etc. Employees at Parasol Insurance either using the system for the first time or using it for e.g. detecting fraud, tyring to understand the glossary, acronyms etc. A good example is `Policy ID,` a unique ID for policy in our database systems. The LLM does not know about this. By adding this, we can ensure that once a claims agent or an application asks about a policy ID, the LLM can give reasonable answers and suggestions. 

Create a new folder `parasol_claims_data` under `knowledge > economy > finance > insurance` as shown in the image below

=== Check that the Taxonomy is Recognized by InstructLab

Now that we've added data, let's check that the taxonomy is recognized by InstructLab. This will help us ensure that the data we've added is valid and can be used to generate synthetic training data.

. We're going to run some commands from the terminal, so from the `Terminal` menu, select `New Terminal` to open a new terminal window (or use the terminal you already have open).

image::ilab/vscode-new-terminal-menu.png[Open new VSCode terminal]

. Let's navigate to the `instructlab` directory:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
cd ~/instructlab
----

. Now, activate the Python virtual environment:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
source venv/bin/activate
----

. Run the following command to check the validity of the taxonomy:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
ilab taxonomy diff
----

After running the above command you should be able to see the following output. 

[source,bash]
----
└─> ilab diff                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    (base)

knowledge/economy/finance/insurance/driving_age/qna.yaml
knowledge/economy/finance/insurance/parasol_insurance/qna.yaml
knowledge/economy/finance/insurance/parasol_policies/qna.yaml
Taxonomy in taxonomy is valid :)

If you do not see output similar to above, you may not have added in all of the Q&A files. This is important as the model will use these files to generate synthetic data in the next section.

== Generating Synthetic Training Data & Training the New Model

Now that we've added some initial data, let's use InstructLab to generate synthetic training data. Large Language Models inherently require a large amount of data to be effective, and it can be difficult to find enough real-world data for a niche domain. However, by using InstructLab, we can generate synthetic data that can be used to train the model. 

. Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code.

image::ilab/vscode-new-terminal-menu.png[Open new VSCode terminal]

[start=2]
. Run the following command to generate synthetic training data:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
cd ~/instructlab
----

[start=3]
. Activate the Python virtual environment:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
source venv/bin/activate
----

[start=4]
. Run the data generation command:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
ilab data generate  --num-instructions 5
----

To reduce the amount of time the generation process takes, we are setting the "--num-instructions" flag to "5", the default for this value is "100". If we were generating data for a production deployment we would likely set this value even higher.

This process may take some time, depending on the amount of data and the computational resources available. Once the generation stage is complete, you should see something like this:

[source,bash]
----
$ ilab data generate --num-instructions 5

Q> How long does it take to accelerate to 88 miles per hour in a DeLorean DMC-12?
I> 
A> Approximately 8.8 seconds is needed to reach 88 mph in a Delorean DMC-12.

A> If you are at fault, to be able to claim for your own lost wages from Parasol Insurance, you need to have the optional Apex plus package which provides coverage of loss of income insurance as part of your policy. If another driver is at fault, the at-fault driver’s auto insurance company is typically responsible for covering your lost income. But if an at-fault driver is uninsured or doesn’t have enough coverage to pay for your injuries or car damage, Parasol underinsured motorist coverage can help pay the difference. Uninsured motorist coverage is provided as part of the optional Apex plus package.

Q> What is Bodily Injury Limit?
I>
A> It means how much a company will cover in case you or someone else was hurt, not including property damage.

We can examine the output of the generation stage by taking a look at the "generated" folder in `~/instructlab`. Within this folder you'll see 4 different files:

* `discarded_merlinite-7b-lab-Q4_K_M_DATETIME.log`: This contains a log of any generated instructions which were discarded during the generation process for any reason e.g. "didn't match expected format"
* `generated_merlinite-7b-lab-Q4_K_M_DATETIME.json`: This contains the list of generated instructions plus context with which the model training instructions will be created
* `test_merlinite-7b-lab-Q4_K_M_DATETIME.jsonl`: This file contains test prompts and responses which are used at the end of the training process
* `train_merlinite-7b-lab-Q4_K_M_DATETIME.jsonl`: This file contains the instructions used during the train process to train the model.


=== Training the Model with New Data

With our synthetic data generated, we should now be in a position to train the model.  Because we only created 5 sample instructions and due to time constraints we're not going to perform the actual training in this lab.

If we were to do this, we would again use the "ilab" CLI with the "model train" command. Something like `ilab model train --iters 10 --device cuda`. Depending on the hardware available, this can take anywhere from several minutes to several hours or days. Once this process was finished we would then have a model we can serve locally with ilab to test our results.

=== Serve the new the Model

We have provisioned a trained model in the folder `~/instructlab/models` called `parasol-model.gguf`. Serve this model by running the following command in the terminal:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
ilab model serve --model-path ~/instructlab/models/parasol-model.gguf
----
It may take a minute to start, but you should see the following:

[source,bash]
----
(venv) [instruct@bastion instructlab]$ ilab model serve --model-path ~/instructlab/models/parasol-model.gguf
INFO 2024-09-09 16:01:01,652 serve.py:51: serve Using model '/home/instruct/instructlab/models/parasol-model.gguf' with -1 gpu-layers and 4096 max context size.

INFO 2024-09-09 16:02:14,664 server.py:219: server After application startup complete see http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs for API.
----

=== Interacting with the Model

To chat, open a new terminal using the `+` button above the terminal:

image::ilab/second-terminal.png[Launch Activities]

In the new terminal, run the following command to begin a chat session with the model:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
cd ~/instructlab
source venv/bin/activate
ilab chat
----

We can now ask the trained model some parasol specific questions such as:

- Does Parasol insurance policies include  loss of income cover if the insured driver is at fault?

- Will Parasol insurance cover the cost of car rental if my car is undriveable as a result of an accident?

- What is Apex plus from parasol insurance?

image::ilab/new-model-responses.png[Launch Activities]

The answers are specific to Parasol's policies and demonstrate the ability for organizations to fine-tune models with their own data, to improve the accuracy of responses, which can be used in many use cases. 

== Conclusion

This exercise showed how organizations can leverage fine tuning with InstructLab to improve the accuracy of LLM responses. Here's a quick summary of what we have learned:

* You Learned about *fine-tuning* techniques for AI models, incorporating Parasol's unique insurance expertise into LLMs
* Your also learned how to create and utilize a *custom knowledge base* for training AI models with organization-specific scenarios and regulations
* Apply the https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01081[*LAB methodology*] to generate synthetic training data and specialize our model while keeping data in-house
* You gained hands-on experience in *training and serving* a customized AI model
* You understand the *benefits and limitations* of fine-tuning compared to other AI customization methods

These skills and tools will be invaluable as you continue to develop AI-enabled applications at Parasol Insurance, allowing you to quickly iterate on ideas and integrate powerful AI capabilities into your workflow.
