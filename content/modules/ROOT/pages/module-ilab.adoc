== Adapting AI Models for an Enterprise Use Case

As Parasol Insurance embraces the era of AI, we face a unique challenge: leveraging cutting-edge AI technology while maintaining strict control over our proprietary data and processes. This journey requires us to develop in-house AI capabilities that are as powerful as they are secure. In this exercise, you will:

* Explore *fine-tuning* techniques for AI models, incorporating Parasol's unique insurance expertise into LLMs
* Learn how to create and utilize a *custom knowledge base* for training AI models with organization-specific scenarios and regulations
* Apply the *InstructLab* methodology to generate synthetic training data and specialize our model while keeping data in-house
* Gain hands-on experience in *training and serving* a customized AI model
* Understand the *benefits and limitations* of fine-tuning compared to other AI customization methods

=== Enterprise Needs for an AI Model

This lab will equip you to enhance Parasol's AI capabilities in three key areas:

1. Generating product-specific email templates
2. Providing comprehensive policy and product information
3. Offering insights on relevant local regulations

Through fine-tuning, you'll learn how to provide an LLM accurate and relevant information to provide more efficient, accurate, and compliant customer service.

=== Enhancing AI Models: RAG vs Fine-Tuning

When customizing AI models, two techniques stand out: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning. 

* *Fine-tuning* excels when you need precise, controlled outputs for specialized tasks using curated data. It's ideal for applications where security and compliance require embedding all data within the model. Fine-tuning is also suitable when you have clear use cases with specific task requirements.

image::ilab/rag-vs-finetuning-1.png[RAG vs Fine-Tuning]

* In contrast, *Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)* is best when you need real-time access to dynamic knowledge bases, especially in environments with constantly updating information. RAG allows for scalability and handles out-of-domain queries effectively without the need for retraining, making it quick solution for improving model output. However, by providing contextual information to the model for each prompt, your expenses and computer resources may be higher than "baking-in" information into the model through fine-tuning.

image::ilab/rag-vs-finetuning-2.png[RAG vs Fine-Tuning]

== Get Started with Fine-Tuning

Now that we've outlined Parasol's AI needs, let's dive into the process of meeting them. In this section, we'll explore how to use the InstructLab project to tailor a foundation language model to Parasol's specific requirements, focusing on the key areas we've identified.

=== What is InstructLab?

https://instructlab.ai/[InstructLab] is an open-source project designed to enhance large language models (LLMs) for use in generative AI applications. It provides a novel approach to model alignment and fine-tuning, allowing developers and domain experts to add new knowledge and skills to pre-trained models with minimal data and computational resources. Key features of InstructLab include:

* A taxonomy-driven approach to curating training data
* Large-scale synthetic data generation
* Iterative alignment tuning for continuous model improvement

image::ilab/instructlab-components.png[InstructLab Overview]

InstructLab is particularly useful for organizations that want to leverage private AI and keep their data in-house while still benefiting from state-of-the-art language models, without needing AI/ML or data science expertise.

=== Access your Virtual Environment

To begin working with InstructLab, you'll need to access the provided noNVC virtual environment. This environment comes pre-configured with all necessary tools and dependencies: {novnc_url}[*{novnc_url}*,window=_blank], using the password `{password}`.

== Training the Model for the Insurance Organization

The InstructLab taxonomy is a structured knowledge base that guides the model fine-tuning process. By customizing the taxonomy, we can add domain-specific knowledge to the model.

In this section, we'll walk through the process of fine-tuning an AI model using InstructLab. We'll start by setting up our environment, generating synthetic training data, training the model, and then interacting with it. We will build upon that and delve further into the biggest insurance company in North America, Parasol, which has the most extensive customer base. Parasol Insurance gets many requests to process claims, questions about different products, etc. These requests are not just internal but also external.

Parasol Insurance's primary concern is ensuring that its staff is capable of handling such requests and has access to this information through a single interface rather than going through multiple systems to scrape documents and internal portal pages. To this end, you have been tasked with adding knowledge that will aid the following use cases. 

. Products and coverage
. Basic knowledge of the Insurance rules
. Responses to general claim questions and remedies.

=== Preparing the Parasol Insurance Knowledge Base

Your role is crucial in this process. You must first add a knowledge domain to the LLM. We will follow a procedure similar to the one in the previous section and add more comprehensive knowledge for the insurance domain. Knowledge that the LLM doesn't have and is specific to Parasol Insurance.

=== Understanding the Knowledge Structure

Knowledge consists of data and facts and is backed by documents. When you create knowledge for a model, you're giving it additional data to more accurately answer questions.

Knowledge contributions in this project contain a few things.

- A file in a https://github.com/rh-rad-ai-roadshow/parasol_knowledge[git repository] that holds your information. For example, these repositories can include markdown versions of information on: Parasol products, insurance domain knowledge, claims processing etc.
- A `qna.yaml` file that asks and answers questions about the information in the git repository.
- An `attribution.txt` that includes the sources for the information used in the qna.yaml.

LLMs have inherent limitations that make certain tasks extremely difficult, like doing math problems. They're great at other tasks, like creative writing. And they could be better at things like logical reasoning.

An LLM with knowledge helps it create a basis of information that it can learn from, then you can teach it to use this knowledge via the qna.yaml files. In our case we want the LLM to learn more about Parasol Insurance. 

A knowledge file looks as follows: 

[.console-input]
[source,yaml]
----
version: 2<1>
task_description: "Teach a model more details about Parasol Insurance"<2>
created_by: sshaaf<3>
domain: insurance<4>
seed_examples:<5>
  - question: What is class imbalance in the context of Parasol insurance claims datasets?
    answer: |
      Class imbalance refers to the situation where the number of non-claims instances far exceeds
      that of actual claims, posing challenges for predictive modeling.

document:<6>
  repo: https://github.com/sshaaf/parasol_knowledge.git
  commit: b87677d
  patterns: <7>
    - Insurance_claims_data.md
----

Each `qna.yaml` file requires a minimum of five question-answer pairs. The `qna.yaml` format must include the following fields:

<1>`version`: Defines the InstructLab taxonomy schema version
<2> `task_description`: An optional description of the knowledge for easily understanding the specific knowledge contribution
<3> `created_by`: The author of the contribution, typically a GitHub username
<4> `domain`: Category of the knowledge
<5> `seed_examples`: Five or more examples sourced from the provided knowledge documents, representing a `question` for the model and desired `response`
<6> `document`: The source of your knowledge contribution, consisting of a `repo` URL pointing to the knowlege markdown files, and `commit` SHA that contains the specific files
<7> `patterns`: A list of glob patterns specifying the markdown files in your repository. Any glob pattern that starts with `*`, such as `*.md`, must be quoted due to YAML rules. For example, `"*.md"`. In our case we have placed all the knowledge documents in the https://github.com/rh-rad-ai-roadshow/parasol_knowledge[parasol-knoledge] repository.

Now that we understand the constructs of Knowledge let's go ahead and create our knowledge base, which we will then feed into the LLM to train. This will help our applications that ask the LLM about Parasol. Furthermore, it will help with Claims processing, Fraud detection, or anyone who would like to ask the LLM about products, coverage, laws, and some information about Parasol itself. Let's get started! 

You can open VSCode by following the instructions below:

. Open the `instructlab` directory in Visual Studio Code through the terminal:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
code -r .
----

. Navigate to the `taxonomy/knowledge/` folder  . This file will contain the questions and answers that will be used to train the model.

Lets create a structure for Parasol insurance knowledge.
To do that create folders by first right clicking on the `Knowledge` folder, and then pressing `New Folder`, as shown in the screen shot below

image::ilab/ilab-taxanomy-create-folder.png[New Folder]

We should create a knowledge folder structure that we can add to later as we add more knowledge and for our peers to also understand how its structured. Lets create a structure like this `knowledge > economy > finance > insurance`. In VSCode this is quite easy. In the field as shown in the image below type `economy/finance/insurance`

image::ilab/ilab-taxonomy-create-folder2.png[New folder]

Perfect now we have the basic working structure. 

Let’s now start adding the taxonomy knowledge files for Parasol Insurance.

==== Knowledge File: Driving Age
// - **Driving age**: 

There are specific driving age rules for New Hampshire and Alaska for Teens driving. Lets add this information to the Model. 

Create a new folder `driving_age` under `knowledge > economy > finance > insurance` as shown in the image below

Copy the following and add it as a new file called `qna.yaml` in the folder `driving_age` as shown in the image above. `qna.yaml` file ("qna" is short for "questions and answers")

==== Knowledge File: Parasol Claims Data
// - **Parasol claims data**

Like any insurance company on the planet, data is stored into multiple systems, files etc. Employees at Parasol Insurance either using the system for the first time or using it for e.g. detecting fraud, tyring to understand the glossary, acronyms etc. A good example is `Policy ID,` a unique ID for policy in our database systems. The LLM does not know about this. By adding this, we can ensure that once a claims agent or an application asks about a policy ID, the LLM can give reasonable answers and suggestions. 

Create a new folder `parasol_claims_data` under `knowledge > economy > finance > insurance` as shown in the image below

=== Check that taxonomy is recognized by instructLab
. We're going to run some commands from the terminal, so from the `Terminal` menu, select `New Terminal` to open a new terminal window.

image::ilab/vscode-new-terminal-menu.png[Open new VSCode terminal]

. Run the following command to check the diff:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ~/instructlab
----
. Activate the Python virtual environment:
+
[source,bash]
----
source venv/bin/activate
----
. Run the data generation command:
+
[source,bash]
----
ilab diff
----

After running the above command you should be able to see the following output. 

[source,bash]
----
└─> ilab diff                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    (base) 
You are using an aliased command, this will be deprecated in a future release. Please consider using `ilab taxonomy diff` instead
knowledge/economy/finance/insurance/parasol_claims_data/qna.yaml
knowledge/economy/finance/insurance/driving_age/qna.yaml
knowledge/economy/finance/insurance/parasol_insurance/qna.yaml
knowledge/economy/finance/insurance/parasol_policies/qna.yaml
Taxonomy in taxonomy is valid :)
----

If you do not see output similar to above. Please review all the steps above. In the next section we will genearate Synthtetic data from our QnA pairs.

=== Generating Synthetic Training Data

Now that we've added some initial data, let's use InstructLab to generate synthetic training data.

. Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code.
. Run the following command to generate synthetic training data:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd ~/instructlab
----
. Activate the Python virtual environment:
+
[source,bash]
----
source venv/bin/activate
----
. Run the data generation command:
+
[source,bash]
----
ilab data generate  --num-instructions 5
----

To reduce the amount of time the generation process takes, we are setting the "--num-instructions" flag to "5", the default for this value is "100". If we were generating data for a production deployment we would likely set this value even higher.

This process may take some time, depending on the amount of data and the computational resources available. 

Once the generation stage is complete, you should see something like
[source,bash]

We can examine the output of the generation stage by taking a look at the "generated" folder in ~/instructlab

within this folder you'll see 4 different files

* discarded_merlinite-7b-lab-Q4_K_M_DATETIME.log: This contains a log of any generated instructions which were discarded during the generation process for any reason e.g. "didn't match expected format"
* generated_merlinite-7b-lab-Q4_K_M_DATETIME.json: This contains the list of generated instructions plus context with which the model training instructions will be created
* test_merlinite-7b-lab-Q4_K_M_DATETIME.jsonl: This file contains test prompts and responses which are used at the end of the training process
* train_merlinite-7b-lab-Q4_K_M_DATETIME.jsonl: This file contains the instructions used during the train process to train the model.


=== Training the Model with New Data

With our synthetic data generated, we should now be in a position to train the model.  Because we only created 5 sample instructions and due to time contrainsts we're not going to perform the actual training in this lab.

If we where to do this, we would again use the "ilab" CLI with the "model train" command

Once this process was finished we would then have a model we can serve locally with ilab to test our results.


=== Interacting with the Model

We have provisioned a trained model in the folder `~/instructlab/models` called `parasol-model.gguf`

. We can serve this model with the command
. Run the data generation command:
+
[source,bash]
----
ilab model serve --model-path ~/instructlab/models/parasol-model.gguf
----

We can now ask the trained model some parasol specific questions such as:

- Who founded parasol insurance?

- Will Parasol insurance cover the cost of car rental if my car is undriveable as a result of an
 accident?
