image::discovery/playground-new.png[Podman AI Lab Playground New]

The Playground interface offers several technical features for fine-tuning model behavior:

* *System Prompt*:
** Located at the top of the chat interface, this allows you to set the context and behavior of the AI model.
* *Hyperparameter Tuning*: The *Settings* widget on the right side provides access to crucial parameters:
** *Temperature*: Controls the randomness of the model's responses. Lower values produce more deterministic outputs, while higher values introduce more randomness.
** *Max Tokens*: Limits the number of tokens generated by the model, which can help prevent overly verbose responses.
** *Top P*: Determines the number of tokens to consider for each step of the model's generation process. Higher values can lead to more diverse responses.

By systematically testing various configurations and prompts related to insurance scenarios, developers can gain insights into model performance and identify optimal settings for specific use cases within Parasol Insurance's applications. This process of experimentation and analysis in the Playground environment is crucial for understanding model capabilities and limitations before integration into production systems.

For our specific use case, let's make an adjustment to the summarization behavior to better align with Parasol Insurance's claim processing requirements:

[start=2]
. Find the `refine_template` variable in the `summarizer.py` file.
. Modify the template to include additional details about the claimant, including policy number, and claim type:

[.console-input]
[source,puthon,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
refine_template = PromptTemplate.from_template(
    "Summarize this insurance claim document:\n"
    "Existing summary: {existing_answer}\n"
    "New context:\n"
    "------------\n"
    "{text}\n"
    "------------\n"
    "Refine the summary, focusing on:\n"
    "1. Incident date and location\n"
    "2. Type of claim (e.g., auto, property)\n"
    "3. Claimed amount\n"
    "4. Key policy details relevant to the claim\n"
    "Use bullet points, maximum 10 points."
)
----

image::discovery/text-summarization-app-refine.png[Podman AI Lab Text Summarization Application Refine]

By updating the template with these specific requirements, you can tailor the summarization output to provide more detailed and relevant information for insurance claims processing at Parasol Insurance. 

[start=4]
. Save your changes.
. Switch back to Podman Desktop and to the running `Summarizer` recipe
