== Deploy the existing Parasol application in Red Hat Developer Hub

https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-developer-hub[Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)^] is an enterprise-grade, self-managed, and customizable *developer portal* built on top of https://backstage.io/[Backstage.io^]. It's designed to streamline the development process for organizations, specifically those using Red Hat products and services. Here's a breakdown of its key benefits:

* *Increased Developer Productivity*: Reduces time spent searching for resources and setting up environments.
* *Improved Collaboration*: Provides a central platform for developers to share knowledge and best practices.
* *Reduced Cognitive Load*: Minimizes the need for developers to juggle multiple tools and resources.
* *Enterprise-Grade Support*: Backed by Red Hat's support infrastructure, ensuring stability and reliability.

Red Hat Developer Hub has already been installed and configured in the workshop environment.

=== Access Red Hat Developer Hub

Red Hat Developer Hub integrates with https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on/[Red Hat Single Sign On (RH-SSO)^] to enhance security and user experience for developers within an organization. By integrating with RH-SSO, developers only need to log in once to access both RHDH and other applications secured by RH-SSO. This eliminates the need to manage multiple login credentials for different developer tools and services. RH-SSO centralizes user authentication and authorization to strengthen security by ensuring only authorized users can access RHDH and other protected resources. In addition, The platform engineering team can manage user access and permissions centrally through RH-SSO, simplifying administration and reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

To get started, *access* https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[Red Hat Developer Hub Dashboard^] to authenticate by *GitLab*.

Choose the *GitLab* option.

=== Use software templates to deploy the Parasol Customer Service App

In Red Hat Developer Hub, a software template serves as a pre-configured blueprint for creating development environments and infrastructure. Software templates streamline the process of setting up development environments by encapsulating pre-defined configurations. This saves developers time and effort compared to manually configuring everything from scratch.

Click on `Create...` on the left menu. Then, type *Parasol* in the search bar. Then, `Choose` the *Parasol Insurance for Red Hat AI App Development (RAD) Workshop* template.
