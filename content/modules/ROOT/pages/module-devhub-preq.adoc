== Deploy the existing Parasol applications in Red Hat Developer Hub

https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-developer-hub[Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)^] is an enterprise-grade, self-managed, and customizable *developer portal* built on top of https://backstage.io/[Backstage.io^]. It's designed to streamline the development process for organizations, specifically those using Red Hat products and services. Here's a breakdown of its key Benefits:

* *Increased Developer Productivity*: Reduces time spent searching for resources and setting up environments.
* *Improved Collaboration*: Provides a central platform for developers to share knowledge and best practices.
* *Reduced Cognitive Load*: Minimizes the need for developers to juggle multiple tools and resources.
* *Enterprise-Grade Support*: Backed by Red Hat's support infrastructure, ensuring stability and reliability.

Red Hat Developer Hub has already been installed and configured in the workshop environment.

=== Access Red Hat Developer Hub

Red Hat Developer Hub can integrate with https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on/[Red Hat Single Sign On (RH-SSO)^] to enhance security and user experience for developers within an organization. By integrating with RH-SSO, developers only need to log in once to access both RHDH and other applications secured by RH-SSO. This eliminates the need to manage multiple login credentials for different developer tools and services. RH-SSO can centralize user authentication and authorization to strengthen security by ensuring only authorized users can access RHDH and other protected resources. In addition, The platform engineer team can manage user access and permissions centrally through RH-SSO, simplifying administration and reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

To get started, *access* https://keycloak-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[Red Hat Developer Hub Dashboard^] with the following credential:

* *Username*: 

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
{user}
----

* *Password*: 

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
{password}

=== Create a Parasol LLM software template

In Red Hat Developer Hub, a software template serves as a pre-configured blueprint for creating development environments and infrastructure. Here's a closer look at software templates in Dev Hub. Software templates streamline the process of setting up development environments by encapsulating pre-defined configurations. This saves developers time and effort compared to manually configuring everything from scratch.

Click on `Create...` on the left menu. Then, type *Parasol* in the search bar. Then, `Choose` the *Parasol Insurance for Red Hat AI App Development (RAD) Workshop* template.

Follow the next steps to create a component based on the pre-defined Software Templates:

==== Provide information about the Gitlab location

*GitLab Host* is to use this input data to upload the source repository and manifests. in the Red Hat Developer Hub. You'll use a private GitLab server on the OpenShift today. Replace the *Gitlab Host* with the folowing domain.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}
----

image::devhub/st_gitlab_info.png[]  

*Group Id* is the GitLab organization already configured in the Red Hat Developer to manage the source repository and manifests.

Click on *Next*.

==== Provide information about the cluster Id:

*Cluster Id* is to use this input data to build and deploy the application in the Red Hat Developer Hub. Replace the *Cluster Id* with the following domain.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}
----

*Namespace* is a project in the OpenShift cluster where the application will be deployed. The workshop environment is already created the unique project named, *parasol-{user}* for you.

*Owner* is your user ID to use this input data in the build and deployment process in the Red Hat Developer. Choose your user ID (`user:{user}`) in the drop-down list.

image::devhub/st_component_clusterid.png[]  

Click on *Next*.

==== Provide build information:

* *Image Host*: Your application image will be stored in the internal OpenShift registry. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this image for building and deploying your application.
* *Image Tag*: Composed of the application name and a version identifier, will be used by Red Hat Developer Hub for building and deploying your application.
* *Component ID*: The application name will be used as the component ID for the build and deployment process.

Replace the *Component ID* with the followingunique component ID.: 

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
parasol-app-{user}
----

When you click on *Review*, you will see the following review information.

image::devhub/st_component_review.png[]  

click on *Create* to proceed.

== Observe the application overview

You have just created the Parasol application with Red Hat Developer Hub. Explore the components and the application overview.

=== Open component in catalog

With all your activities in green, click `Open Component in catalog`. 

image::devhub/task_activity.png[]

The Dev Hub will open a new tab with the component information. It will take some time to review the information in the screen:

image::devhub/parasol_overview.png[] 

=== View source

Click on `VIEW SOURCE` to access the new source code repository created.

image::devhub/parasol_source.png[] 

Go back to your parasol component on the Red Hat Developer Hub: https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/catalog/default/component/parasol-app-{user}[Red Hat Developer Hub UI^].

=== Review continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)

Click on `CI` tab to review your pipeline information. The pipeline will be triggered in a few seconds. After a few minutes, you will see the pipeline finished as *Succeeded*.

image::devhub/parasol_pipeline.png[] 

Click on `CD` to review ArgoCD History.

image::devhub/frontend_argohistory.png[] 

Click on `TOPOLOGY` to review your deployment status. Then, you will see the deployment *parasol-app-{user}* in the Topology.

image::devhub/parasol_deployment.png[]

=== Verify the deployment

Access the https://frontend-app-{user}-globex-devhub-{user}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[Parasol web page^] to verify everything is working as expected.

image::devhub/parasol_ui_web.png[]

Now, you've confirmed what the existing Parasol application look like and how it works.

== Log in Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces

Go back to the https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/catalog/default/component/frontend-app-{user}[Parasol component^] in the Red Hat Developer Hub. From the *OVERVIEW* tab click on `OpenShift Dev Spaces (VS Code)` to make the necessary source code changes.

image::devhub/frontend_devspaces.png[frontend_devspaces, 700]

Click on `Log in with OpenShift`.
