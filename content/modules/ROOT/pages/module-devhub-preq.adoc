== Deploy the existing Parasol applications in Red Hat Developer Hub

https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-developer-hub[Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)^] is an enterprise-grade, self-managed, and customizable *developer portal* built on top of https://backstage.io/[Backstage.io^]. It's designed to streamline the development process for organizations, specifically those using Red Hat products and services. Here's a breakdown of its key Benefits:

* *Increased Developer Productivity*: Reduces time spent searching for resources and setting up environments.
* *Improved Collaboration*: Provides a central platform for developers to share knowledge and best practices.
* *Reduced Cognitive Load*: Minimizes the need for developers to juggle multiple tools and resources.
* *Enterprise-Grade Support*: Backed by Red Hat's support infrastructure, ensuring stability and reliability.

Red Hat Developer Hub has already been installed and configured in the workshop environment.

=== Access Red Hat Developer Hub

Red Hat Developer Hub can integrate with https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on/[Red Hat Single Sign On (RH-SSO)^] to enhance security and user experience for developers within an organization. By integrating with RH-SSO, developers only need to log in once to access both RHDH and other applications secured by RH-SSO. This eliminates the need to manage multiple login credentials for different developer tools and services. RH-SSO can centralize user authentication and authorization to strengthen security by ensuring only authorized users can access RHDH and other protected resources. In addition, The platform engineer team can manage user access and permissions centrally through RH-SSO, simplifying administration and reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

To get started, *access* https://developer-hub-backstage-globex-devhub.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[Red Hat Developer Hub Dashboard^] with the following credential:

* *Username*: 

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
{user}
----

* *Password*: 

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
{password}

=== Create a Parasol LLM software template

In Red Hat Developer Hub, a software template serves as a pre-configured blueprint for creating development environments and infrastructure. Here's a closer look at software templates in Dev Hub. Software templates streamline the process of setting up development environments by encapsulating pre-defined configurations. This saves developers time and effort compared to manually configuring everything from scratch.

Click on `Create...` on the left menu. Then, select the `Parasol LLM` template.

image::devhub/software_template_parasol_llm.png[software_template_parasol_llm, 600]  

Follow the next steps to create a component based on the pre-defined Software Templates:

==== Provide information about the Gitlab location

* *Repo Host*: is the Gitlab domain already installed in OpenShift. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data to upload the source repository and manifests.

** Replace the *Repo Host* with the OpenShift domain: 

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
Gitlab-Gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}
----

image::devhub/st_Gitlab_info.png[st_Gitlab_info, 800]  

* *Repo Group*: is the Gitlab organization already configured. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data to upload the source repository and manifests.

* Click on *Next*

==== Provide information about the cluster Id:

* *Cluster Id*: is the OpenShift domain. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data to build and deploy the application.

** Replace the *Cluster Id* with the OpenShift domain: 

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}
----

image::devhub/st_component_clusterid.png[st_component_clusterid, 800]  

* *Namespace*:  is the OpenShift namespace. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data to build and deploy the application in that namespace.

** Replace the *N* with the user number:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
globex-devhub-{user}
----

image::devhub/st_component_namespace.png[st_component_namespace, 800]  

*Note*: Each lab participant is already assigned a unique namespace to be used for all the applications. Each application will have a shared identification based on your user name. 

* *Owner*: The owner is your user ID. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data in the build and deployment process.
** Write your user id: 

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
qa-{user}
----

image::devhub/st_component_owner.png[st_component_owner, 800]  

* Click on *Next*

==== Provide build information:

* *Image Host*: The application image will be stored in this registry URL. For this lab, we are using the internal registry of OpenShift. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data for the application build and deployment process.

* *Image Tag*: The image tag used to identify the image. The image will be composed by the application name and tag. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data for the application build and deployment process.

* *Component ID*: The component ID is the application name. Red Hat Developer Hub will use this input data for the application build and deployment process.

** Replace the *Component ID* using *YOUR* user number: 

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
parasol-app-{user}
----

image::devhub/st_component_componentid_quarkus.png[st_component_componentid_quarkus, 800]  

* Click on *Review*.

* Review the data.

*Sample data*

* Click on *Create*.

== Observe the application overview

You have just created the Parasol application with Red Hat Developer Hub. Explore the components and the application overview.

=== Open component in catalog

With all your activities in green, click `Open Component in catalog`. 

image::devhub/task_activity.png[]

The Dev Hub will open a new tab with the component information. It will take some time to review the information in the screen:

image::devhub/parasol_overview.png[] 

=== View source

Click on `VIEW SOURCE` to access the new source code repository created.

image::devhub/parasol_source.png[] 

Go back to your parasol component on the Red Hat Developer Hub: https://developer-hub-backstage-globex-devhub.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/catalog/default/component/parasol-app-{user}[Red Hat Developer Hub UI^].

=== Review continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD)

Click on `CI` tab to review your pipeline information. The pipeline will be triggered in a few seconds. After a few minutes, you will see the pipeline finished as *Succeeded*.
