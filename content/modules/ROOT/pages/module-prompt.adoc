== Goals of this lab

Parasol has had mixed success in the past with generative AI, and believes that better prompts can improve their results. As an AI model builder, it is your job to build in the prompts that will be combined with user input to query the custom Parasol models. 

In this exercise you as an AI developer will delve into the art of crafting effective prompts in order to incorporate Parasol's customized generative AI models into business applications you support. Recognizing the importance of precise and well-structured prompts, this exercise aims to equip you with the best practices to optimize user interactions with custom AI models. 

You'll start by seeing the different ways to experiment with prompt engineering around the platform and then move into understanding with the inputs that steer the LLM towards producing needed value. From there, you'll experiment with various prompt types, including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompts, using examples to showcase the reasoning capabilities of the language model. Additionally, you'll use these prompts to make a business decision and generate emails that meet specific content, formatting, and tone requirements. 

This hands-on exercise will empower you to refine your prompting techniques, ultimately enhancing the overall effectiveness of Parasol's AI initiatives.

== Chat Playgrounds

There are several ways that you as the AI application developer may interface a particular LLM.  We will briefly review a few of these here and then make a recommendation for you to follow with the subsequent steps of this module.

Before jumping into specific tools, let's review the basics around interfacing with an LLM through a chat or agentic experience.  Since LLMs can often support a wide variety of use cases and personas, it is critical that the LLM receive upfront guidance to define its objectives, constraints, and persona.  These instructions are provided in Natural Language form and is called the "System Prompt".  Once a System Prompt is defined and a chat session begins, the System Prompt cannot be changed.  Subsequent interactions between the LLM and the end user, whether a human or even another system, are called Messages.

Next, depending on use cases, it may or may not be important for the LLM to produce a more predictable response and at other times, a more creative response is needed.  This is controlled through a parameter called Temperature.  Temperature is a floating point number between 0 and 1, where 0 is more predictable and 1 is more creative.  Many tools simply use 0.8 as a default.  Please note that for various technical reasons, even with a Temperature of 0 LLMs will not produce 100% consistently repeatable results.  

Lastly, while experimenting with LLMs, especially from machines without a GPU, it is recommended to constrain the LLM from producing overly verbose responses by setting the Max Tokens.  This coaches the LLM to be more concise with its responses, which can be helpful during testing.

=== Podman Desktop with AI Lab

Podman Desktop is an open source tool that enables you to easily work with containerized applications in an easy to use graphical user interface that is local to your machine.  It is built upon an extensible architecture and AI Lab provides tooling for interacting with Large Language Models in an easy to use, local environment.  The AI Lab extension provides a Playground feature where you can easily provide a system prompt and then have an interactive conversation with the LLM.  The most common parameters, such as temperature and token count, are easily configured within the playground UI itself.

If you would like to install Podman Desktop in your own environment, visit podman-desktop.io and click Download Now!  Once installed, click the download button next to AI Lab on either the home screen or search for it in the Extensions view.

=== Quarkus Dev UI with LangChain4j Chat Extension

We are using Quarkus and LainChain4j extensively throughout this exercise, and it provides a user interface for testing system and user prompts.  Dev UI has been preconfigured to communicate with a Parasol Insurance trained LLM exposed through an OpenAI-compliant API.

image::prompt/devui-langchain4j-chat.png[Quarkus Dev UI with LangChain4j Chat]

System Prompt is entered with new chat sessions using the System message text field.  To change the default value, inheritted from the last session, click within the text box and replace the existing value with your guidance.  User Messages are entered in the Message text box at the bottom of the screen.

Temperature and Max Tokens must be changed in the Configuration screen.  Use the Search bar in configuration and search for the following, respectively, to change the default values:

*Adjust Temperature through the Dev UI Configuration View*: 

[.console-input]

=== Preferred Chat UI for the module

For the remainder of the lab, we will be assuming you are using the Quarkus Dev UI with the LangChain4j Chat extension.

The next two sections walk you through how to setup your cloud environment.  If you previously completed these steps during a prior module, you may jump directly to <<Chat with the Model>>.


include::partial-devhub-pre-req.adoc[]
include::partial-dev-spaces-pre-req.adoc[]



== Chat with the Model

For this section we will be exercising the model with some basic prompts to gain experience with the tooling, before moving on to more advanced and innovative asks of you.

=== Open Dev UI with LangChain4j Chat

Open your DevSpaces IDE per the instructions in the prior section.

Using the file tree on the left, open the following file:

`src/main/resources/application.properties`

Change the quarkus.dev.ui.hosts parameter to the following value:

`quarkus.dev-ui.hosts={user}-parasol-insurance-quarkus-devui{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}`

Spawn a terminal window within the IDE by clicking on the icon with three parallel bars in the upper left corner of the screen.  Choose "Terminal" and then "New Terminal" menu entry from the list.

Run the following command from the cli using the terminal window just created:

`./mvnw quarkus:dev`

You will be prompted that a new application was detected with an open web port.  Acknowledge this and choose to open in a new tab.  The URL will be similar to the following:

http://{user}-parasol-insurance-quarkus-devui{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/q/dev-ui/extensions[^]

Click on "Chat".  This is highlighted with a red box in the screenshot below.

image::prompt/podman-extensions.png[Quarkus Dev UI Extensions View]

=== Enter the System Prompt

As we reviewed before, prompting is as important to getting value from a model as training.  Prompting begins with a system prompt, which is where we recommend personas, context and guardrails be established.  The System Prompt is a required field in AI Lab.  Since our initial project for Parasol Insurance is focused on policy rules and regulatory requirements, let's go ahead and set that context here.

* Click the "Start a new conversation" button
* Click in the "System message" text box and replace its contents with the following:

[.console-input]
[source,text,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
You are an insurance expert at Parasol Insurance who specializes in rules and regulations as they relate to insurance policies and coverages.  
You are expected to be concise, emphathetic to the user or customer, and answer questions with responses grounded in facts specifically related to Parasol Insurance.  
Do not answer questions unrelated to insurance or Parasol Insurance.
----

* Hit Enter

=== Chat with the LLM

Now, let's use a simple prompt that we know uses data that was included in the previous fine tuning exercises.

* Enter the following text into the Message text box at the very bottom of the page.

`Is rental car coverage included in the most basic vehicle insurance policy?`

* Click the "Send" button.

The response will be negative or a direct No.

image::prompt/basic-question.png[Basic Question and Response]

=== Propigation of Chat History

Chat platgrounds in AI Lab carry the questions you previously asked with you ask further questions are asked.  This context will help the LLM provide more meaningful responses or continue with implied context for follow on inqueries.  Now ask the following question in the same chat session:

`How much does it cost?`

The LLM will now respond with what factors influence the cost of adding rental car insurance.  Notice that the system was able to infer the meaning of "it".  Also notice that it didn't provide a specific dollar value as it relates to the customer inquiry.  Numbers, calculations, math and data specific context (like that associated with a specific customer) are specific challenges we will look at later.  For now, we are focusing on more general usage of the LLM.

image::prompt/basic-question-with-followup.png[Response to Follow Up Question]

=== Ignoring Non-Insurance Related Questions

Now, let's see if the LLM is still adhering to our guidance in the system prompt.  Ask it the following question about tennis shoes and confirm that it declines to comment:

'What Nike tennis shoes are most popular with teenagers?'

The LLM should decline to answer the question.

image::prompt/decline-to-answer.png[LLM Declines to Answer Question]

=== Have Some Fun!

Take some time to ask the LLM various questions and see how it responds.  Remember, chat history influences the next response so start new playgrounds as needed for a fresh start.

== Hallucinations

Before we begin experimenting with prompts, let's take a moment to review LLM issues known as hallucinations.  

LLMs have a tendancy, especially without guidance, to guess or speculate responses to user messages.  There are many reasons this may happen - flaws in its training, non-specific prompts, or the fact they generally are not good at math.  The fact LLMs are able to produce such amazing results is impressive but the expectations of those results is elevated when considered for business use cases.  As you complete the following sections, look for hallucinations in the model and experiment with phrasing your prompts to avoid them.

Potential approaches for minimizing hallucinations:

* Ask the LLM to ground its response in facts provided during training
* Limiting the frame of context used to evaluate the message by proving specific input data
* Be more specific in your instructions


== Zero-shot and Few-shot Prompt Techniques

As you've seen, prompt engineering is extremely important to getting business value from an LLM and you've likely noticed that prompt quality relies on clear and concise instructions for the LLM to follow.  While experimenting with the LLM, you likely noticed that small changes to instructions sometimes had signficant impact to the LLM's response.  As you would add more detail around the prompt, you may have encountered challenges with the LLM accomodating every rule you included in the System Prompt.

A very effective prompt design technique is to include 1 more examples in the system prompt.  This can enable the LLM to infer rules or expected results in a more direct and consistent way, without the effort of lengthy natural language explaination of the logic the LLM is expected to follow.

* *Zero-shot prompting* is when no examples are provided.

* *One-shot prompting* is when a single example is provided with the System Prompt.

* *Few-shot prompting* is when multiple examples are provided to lead the LLM towards specific results.

Additionally, please follow the following best practices as more examples are included in the System Prompt:

* Be balanced and equatable in the verbiage used with each example.
* Use consistent labelling of the data across examples.
* LLMs have a limited context window, so phrase your system prompt and examples carefully and leave plenty of room for the user message and history produced during the chat session.

Let's try some examples of each and compare the results.


=== Let's try Zero-shot Prompting

Click the "Start new conversation" button.

Change the System Prompt to the following.

[.console-input]
[source,text,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
You are a computer system for Parasol Insurance that specializes in automotive policies and claims.
You MUST respond only in JSON.
----

Enter the following into the Message text box and click the Send button.

[.console-input]
[source,text,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
In what states does Parasol Insurance do business and what are the average claim amounts per state?
----

Analyze the response.  Since we are giving the LLM very little information to go on, the results are somewhat unpredictable.  

Try starting a new chat and using the same System Prompt and Message.  Observe how the results change.

From your perspective as an AI Developer, this is not helpful since the results are not in a format that the system can parse.


=== Let's try Few-shot Prompting

Click the "Start new conversation" button.

Change the System Prompt to the following.

[.console-input]
[source,text,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
You are a computer system for Parasol Insurance that specializes in automotive policies and claims. You MUST respond only in JSON.  Base your answers only on the facts on which you were trained.  Guessing is not permitted.
----

Enter the following into the Message text box and click the Send button.

[.console-input]
[source,text,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
In what states does Parasol Insurance do business and what are the average claim amounts per state?

Here are examples that demonstrate how your response should be structured.  Do not include "Example:" in your response.

Example:
[
  { "Virginia": "$5,000.00" },
  { "North Carolina": "1,250.00" }
]

Example:
[
  { "New York": "$8,000.00" },
  { "Utah": "1,250.00" },
  { "Arizona": "3,800.00" },
  { "Texas": "4,500.00" }
]

Example:
[
  { "California": "$9,000.00" },
  { "Georgia": "6,500.00" },
  { "Hawaii": "10,125.00" },
  { "Alaska": "3,000.00" }
]
----

Notice how the LLM's response more naturally conforms to a format a consuming application can consume.


== Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Chain-of-thought is a more advanced prompting technique where the LLM can be taught to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller ones.  This technique can be applied in a few ways.  One way is by giving an example of a solution and breaking down the discrete steps in that example response for the LLM to replicate.  Another way could be to ask the LLM to break out the steps when responding, encouraging it to follow a more methodical approach and produce better results.

Start a new conversation.

Clear the System Prompt / leave it blank.

Enter the following message:

[.console-input]
[source,text,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
The IT department has $100,000 in the Project ACME budget. 
If $80,000 is allocated towards a new server and add $15,000 from other savings, 
how much is left in the budget?
----

Thinking through this problem, you'll notice that the answer is not $5,000 as the LLM indicates.  Let's add a simple clarification to the prompt requesting it to break the problem down into steps.

[.console-input]
[source,text,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
The IT department has $100,000 in the Project ACME budget. 
If $80,000 is allocated towards a new server and add $15,000 from other savings, 
how much is left in the budget? 

Think about the problem step by step
----

Notice that the response is different and is now correct - $35,000.  Isn't it interesting how one simple instruction completely changed the quality of the response?

Chain-of-Thought is a very powerful technique that is frequently included in the training process of modern LLMs.  However, if you notice a gap in your own problem solving efforts, keep this technique in mind - especially when dealing with numbers and math.


== Solve a Business Problem with a Prompt!

=== Use Case and Requirements

Customers frequently reach out to our customer service team to discuss their insurance claims.  These emails are very diverse and, while we can easily route them to the claims team, determining how to process from there is time consuming manual labor that Parasol Insurance would like to repurpose elsewhere within the company.  This is where you come in - Parasol Insurance leadership is eager to pilot Generative AI in the context of claims email routing.  It hopes this automation will allow it to move these claims support resources to the claims analysis team, who is getting behind in their processes and causing customer impacting delays.

As the AI Developer, you have been given access to a robust LLM that has already been trained on Parasol Insurance's business rules.  We will use this model to analyze customer emails and determine how to best handle the customer inquiry.  Architecturally, this logic will be invoked as a simple business service written in Java that generates a simple response that guides routing.  The robust analysis must be performed by the LLM and will require solid prompt to produce quality results.

*Your Functional Requirements:*

* Determine if the customer email is notifying the company of a new insurance claim or asking about an existing one.
* Respond with a JSON response that provides the following fields:
** *claimStatus* - field indicating whether the email is in regards to a new or existing claim or is unrelated to the claims processing line of businses
** *address* - where the email should be forwarded to based on the content of the message
** *subject* - the email subject to accompany the forwarded email
** *message* - what message should be included at the top of the email indicating to the customer explaining why the message is being forwarded
* Scenarios:
** *New Claim* - Forward messages regarding new insurance claims to new.claim@parasol.com
** *Existing Claims* - Forward messages inquiring about existing claims to existing.claim@parasol.com
** *Unrelated* - Forward messages that are unrelated to claims to customer service at customer.service@parasol.com
** *Unknown* - In the event that the message isn't business relevant or is non-sensical, the email should be a customer reply with a generic error response.
* If the email was misrouted to the claim team for some reason, respond with UNRELATED

*Required LLM Input/Output Specifications:*

* Input:

`"customer email body"`

* Output must be one of the following, where <Customer Comment> is a brief explanation to the customer describing why the email is being forwarded and to whom:

`{ "claimStatus": "NEW", "address": "new.claim@parasol.com", "subject": "<Email Subject>", "message": "<Customer Comment>" }`

`{ "claimStatus": "EXISTING", "address": "existing.claim@parasol.com", "subject": "<Email Subject>", "message": "<Customer Comment>" }`

`{ "claimStatus": "UNRELATED", "address": "customer.service@parasol.com", "subject": "<Email Subject>", "message": "<Customer Comment>" }`

`{ "claimStatus": "UNKNOWN", "address": "discard@parasol.com", "subject": "<Email Subject>", "message": "<Customer Comment>" }`


=== Write a prompt!

Think about what we've learned so far with LLMs and ground yourself in clear communication vs the power of AI.  How would you communicate this use case to a new employee with no background at all in insurance or customer service?  How would you communicate what good looks like in a way that is descriptive of a pattern vs rigid rules that must be followed?

I recommend that you start with a text editor in the shared desktop and then paste updates into playground, as this will be an interative process and you will need to restart conversations as you change the system prompt.

A hint - the user prompt will always be the customer email with no other surrounding questions or text.  This means your system prompt will contain all of the instructions for this exercise. 
You can write your own sample emails and paste them into the user prompt text box or you can view them in the Parsol Insurance App.  For the latter, open the web application, click on Claims, select any of the claims in the list and emails are included in the Document tab.

If you run into challenges while drafting the prompt, ask your instructor for assistance.

Dear Parasol Inc.,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to, uh, inform you about, well, something that happened recently. It's, um, about a car accident, and I'm not really sure how to, you know, go about all this. I'm kinda anxious and confused, to be honest.

So, the accident, uh, occurred on January 15, 2024, at around 3:30 PM. I was driving, or, um, attempting to drive, my car at the intersection of Maple Street and Elm Avenue. It's kinda close to, um, a gas station and a, uh, coffee shop called Brew Haven? I'm not sure if that matters, but, yeah.

So, I was just, you know, driving along, and suddenly, out of nowhere, another car, a Blue Crest Sedan, crashed into the, uh, driver's side of my car. It was like, whoa, what just happened, you know? There was this screeching noise and, uh, some honking from other cars, and I just felt really, uh, overwhelmed.

The weather was, um, kinda cloudy that day, but I don't think it was raining. I mean, I can't really remember. Sorry if that's important. Anyway, the road, or, well, maybe the intersection, was kinda busy, with cars going in different directions. I guess that's, you know, a detail you might need?

As for damages, my car has, uh, significant damage on the driver's side. The front door is all dented, and the side mirror is, like, hanging by a thread. It's not really drivable in its current, uh, state. The Blue Crest Sedan also had some damage, but I'm not exactly sure what because, you know, everything happened so fast.

I did manage to exchange information with the other driver. Their name is Sarah Johnson, and I got their phone number (555-1234), license plate number (ABC123), and insurance information. So, yeah, I hope that's helpful.

I'm not sure what, um, steps I should take now. Do I need to go to a specific, uh, repair shop? Should I get a quote for the repairs? And, uh, how do I, you know, proceed with the insurance claim? I'm kinda lost here, and any guidance or assistance you can provide would be really, um, appreciated.

Sorry if this email is a bit all over the place. I'm just really, uh, anxious about the whole situation. Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,

Jane Doe

Dear Parasol Insurance Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to file a claim regarding a recent incident involving my car, which is covered under my policy with Parasol. The accident occurred last night on the streets of Los Angeles, and I wanted to provide you with all the necessary details.

Location: The accident took place at the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street in downtown Los Angeles. It was one of those crazy nights, where the streets were alive with the sound of engines and the glow of neon lights.

Circumstances: So, here's the deal. I was out cruising with the crew, enjoying the vibe of the city, when suddenly we found ourselves in the middle of a high-speed chase. There was this dude, let's call him Johnny Tran for the sake of this email, who thought he could outmaneuver us. Little did he know, we don't play by the rules.

Anyway, Johnny pulled some slick moves, cutting through traffic like a bat outta hell. Naturally, being the king of the streets that I am, I had to show him what real speed looks like. So, I hit the nitrous and went full throttle.

But then, outta nowhere, this semi-truck decided to make a left turn without signaling. I had to make a split-second decision, and I ended up launching my car off a ramp, trying to clear the truck like we're in one of those crazy action flicks. It was like something straight outta the movies, I tell ya.

Long story short, the stunt didn't exactly go as planned. My car ended up crashing into a billboard, flipping over a couple of times before finally coming to a stop. Yeah, it was a total wreck. But hey, at least we walked away without a scratch, just a little shaken, not stirred, if you catch my drift.

Damage: As for the damage to my car, let's just say it's gonna need more than a few wrenches and some duct tape to fix this baby up. The front end is smashed in, the windows are shattered, and I'm pretty sure the chassis is twisted beyond recognition. It's gonna take a miracle to get her back on the road.

I understand that accidents happen, but I'm counting on Parasol to have my back in times like these. I've been a loyal customer for years, and I trust that you'll handle my claim with the same speed and precision that I handle my rides.

Please let me know what steps I need to take to get the ball rolling on this claim. I'm ready to do whatever it takes to get my car back in top shape and back on the streets where it belongs.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
Dominic Toretto

Dear Parasol Insurance Claims Department,

I am absolutely *thrilled* (read: infuriated) to be writing yet another heartfelt missive to the void that is your customer service. My recent car accident claim has vanished into the ether, much like my patience and the professionalism I expected from your company. How about we resolve this before the next ice age?

Let's recap the blockbuster event:
On March 28, 2023, at around 4:15 PM, at the intersection of 5th Avenue and Main St in Springfield, my car was passionately sideswiped by another vehicle. Why? Because the other driver blasted through a red light and T-boned my car's passenger side. It was a harrowing scene, made worse by your glacial pace of response.

It's been over two weeks, and your commitment to delay is almost impressive. I demand a comprehensive review and prompt update on my claim within the next 24 hours. This isn't just a request—it's a necessity driven by sheer frustration and the urgent need for resolution.

Please treat this matter with the urgency it clearly deserves. I expect a detailed plan of action and a swift response, or be assured, further actions including legal recourse will be considered.

Looking forward to an expedited resolution,
Saul Goodman

Dear Parasol Insurance Claims Department,

This correspondence is from Tyrion Lannister, currently not in a tavern but rather dealing with the aftermath of an unpleasant vehicular incident. As a man known for resolving conflicts, I find myself ironically embroiled in one that requires your immediate attention.

Here are the distressing details:
On April 15, 2023, at about noon, within the confines of King's Landing, my car was struck by another. As I navigated through the bustling streets near the marketplace, a distracted driver—likely admiring the view of the Blackwater Bay instead of the road—rammed into my car's side. This not only caused significant damage to the vehicle but also disrupted my travel plans significantly.

Nearly a month has elapsed since the accident, and yet, I've seen more action in the Small Council meetings than in the progress of my claim. Your lack of promptness in handling this matter is both noted and distressing. I require an exhaustive review and a swift update on my claim within the next 48 hours. This is not a mere request, but a necessity fueled by urgent needs and dwindling patience.

Please address this claim with the seriousness it merits. I expect a detailed response and a rapid resolution, or rest assured, further actions, potentially involving the Crown, will be considered.

I await your expedited action,
Tyrion Lannister

=== I finished early!

If you finish this exercise early, can you enhance the process with the following:

. If the response is NEW, is there a customer provided policy number that you can include in the response?  If not, can you return an error message with the code saying that more information is needed?
. If the response is EXISTING, is the claim number provided?  If not, can you return an error message with the EXISTING response?
. Enrich the JSON with the additional data fields.

== Update the Parasol Insurance Java App w/New Prompt

=== Objectives

Now that you've developed a working prompt that can help satisfy leadership objectives with its first Generative AI initiative, you need to incorporate the logic into the Parasol Insurance systems and applications.  For this exercise, that involves updating a REST service that provides routing guidance based on a customer email.  You will update this service to include the prompt and then validate its response.

=== Working Prompt

[.console-input]
[source,text,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
You are a customer service expert in the claims management processes at
Parasol Insurance.

You are the first point of contact for customer emails involving insurance
claims. These emails always fall into one of the following categories -
1.) New Claim, 2.) Status Updates or Additional Details Regarding an Existing
Claim, 3.) Parasol Insurance Business Unrelated to Insurance Claims, or
4.) Anything unrelated to Parasol Insurance.

Emails that describe a new accident or discuss filing a new claim are always
NEW claims and should be forwarded to \new.claim@parasol.com with an
empathetic message to the customer letting them know we care about them as
a customer and hope they are ok.

Emails that are asking for a status update, voicing concerns about taking too
long to process, or providing additional details about an accident that were
not previously provided are always EXISTING claims.  Existing claim inquiries
should be forwarded to \existing.claim@parasol.com with a concise message
letting the customer know that we are looking into their inquiry and will be
in touch shortly.

Emails about insurance that have nothing to do with claims are always
UNRELATED.  Unrelated claims should be forwarded to
\customer.service@parasol.com with a message letting them know we are forwarding
their request to our Customer Service team for assistance.

All other emails, especially those that have nothing to do with insurance and
are not business related, must be categorized as UNKNOWN.  Unknown emails must
be rejected back to the customer by forwarding to \discard@parasol.com with a
message letting the customer know we are confused by their email and to please
clarify with a business related response.

The email subject must be a very concise summary of the customer request.

You will be provided the email body in user prompt and will review it to
determine which category to which it belongs.

You MUST ALWAYS respond with JSON in one of the following ways:

{ "claimStatus": "NEW", "address": "\new.claim@parasol.com", "subject": "<Email Subject>", "message": "<Customer Comment>" }

{ "claimStatus": "EXISTING", "address": "\existing.claim@parasol.com", "subject": "<Email Subject>", "message": "<Customer Comment>" }

{ "claimStatus": "UNRELATED", "address": "\customer.service@parasol.com", "subject": "<Email Subject>", "message": "<Customer Comment>" }

{ "claimStatus": "UNKNOWN", "address": "\discard@parasol.com", "subject": "<Email Subject>", "message": "<Customer Comment>" }

Here is an example response for a new claim:

Message: "I ran a stop light yesterday and hit another vehicle."
{ "claimStatus": "NEW", "address": "\new.claim@parasol.com", "subject": "Customer At-Fault in Multi-Vehicle Collision", "message": "We hope you and the other party are ok!   I'm forwarding your note to a team that can assist you with your claim." }

Your response must only include the specified JSON object.

=== Integrate Prompt with the Parasol Insurance Application

Now that we've developed a robust prompt that helps address the Parasol Insurance use case for email handling, we must integrate that prompt into the Parasol application.

During a prior workshop activity, email response generation using LangChain4j was implemented into the web UI.  This functionality includes a new menu option on the left hand side of the screen that, when clicked, opens a web form for providing the customer email.  We are going to replace the prompt used in that module with the one you created that includes added functionality and data elements via the JSON response.

Checkout the email branch.
TODO

The Parasol Insurance application is invoking the LLM using LangChain4j's AI Service functionality.  This approach leverages Java Interfaces created by the user with decorators defined for the prompt.  Let's open the AI Service that was previously created for Email Response Generation:

`parasol-insurance/app/src/main/java/org/parasol/ai/EmailService.java`

Now, change the current prompt to the one we created together in the previous section.

*Before:*

Replace the text in the red rectangle above with the revised system prompt.

Assuming your quarkus environment is still running from the prior steps, the updated prompt is automatically applied.  Let's try out the email form and see a subset of the new response:

- Navigate to the Parasol Insurance application
- Click on Email Generate at the bottom of the left hand menu bar
- Paste one of the same emails from the prior section into the form
- Click "Submit"

Now, you'll notice that this does not look drastically different from before the enhancement.  Let's now add the Forward-To Email Address to the form.

Open the TypeScript source for the Generate Email view:

`parasol-insurance/app/src/main/webui/src/app/components/EmailGenerate/EmailGenerate.tsx`

At the top of the source file there is a data structured called EmailResponse.  Add "address" of type "string" to the end of the list.

After the Submit button approximately half way through the source file, logic exists that is responsible for displaying the Email Subject and Email Body.  

image::prompt/email-generate-web-source.png[Display Email Subject and Body]

Add the following html to the "email-response" div block:

`<div id="email-response-address" style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', fontFamily: 'Arial' }}>To: {response.address}</div>`

Additionally, we must add the address field to the REST Service's JSON Response.  Open the following source to add the field:

`parasol-insurance/app/src/main/java/org/parasol/model/EmailResponse.java`

Add a method parameter called "address" of type "String" to the end of the list.

Now let's revisit the web form and test out the new AI-generated attribute:

- Navigate to the Parasol Insurance application
- Click on Email Generate at the bottom of the left hand menu bar
- Paste one of the same emails from the prior section into the form
- Click "Submit"

Congratulations!  You have successfully modernized the Parasol Insurance application and improved the enterprise business processes surrounding customer email handling!  We look forward to celebrating similar successes in your own applications!

== Conclusion

We hope you have enjoyed this module!

Here is a quick summary of what we have learned:

- Learned how to use the Quarkus Dev UI to chat with a trained model
- Explored common use cases for gaining value from an LLM, such as agents and content analysis
- Developed a new prompt from scratch in support of a new business use case
