== Goals of this lab

Parasol's developers are always expected to thoroughly test their code. In this exercise, you will explore the unique challenges and techniques involved in testing AI models and applications, which differ significantly from traditional enterprise applications. Traditional apps often have deterministic outputs, whereas AI models can produce varied and context-dependent results, requiring specialized testing approaches. A number of tools are being developed to help enable model testing for example promptfoo, deepeval, and deepchecks. In this module we will use one of these tools "promptfoo" to test the consistency of model responses.

In this lab we're going to use a trained model which has been fine tuned with Parasol Insurance specific data.  We're going to write some tests which will use predefined prompts which should return accurate responses demonstrating the trained model.

To test the responses to ensure they are accurate we're going to use another model (an embedding model) to test for similarity between two sentences.

== Model Testing Overview



== Install Node modules

Open a Terminal window.

image::devhub/new-terminal.png[new-terminal, 500]

Enter the following commands:

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
cd prompt-testing
npm install
----

Once this command has completed you should see the following.

== Run tests

We can now run the tests to ensure they pass.

Navigate to `prompt-testing/index.test.js`

On the left hand panel, click on the "Testing" icon

image::model-testing/testing-panel.png[npm_output, 800]

Click on the "Run Tests" icon at the top as shown below

image::model-testing/run-tests.png[npm_output, 800]

When the test run is complete you should see

== Add new tests

We're now going to add a new test to test some new functionality we've added to the application.

In the file `index.test.js`, add the following to the end of the file replacing the comment: "// ADD NEW TEST HERE"

  Marty was heading south on Colima Road when Biff failed to stop at the red traffic signal on Asuza Avenue, causing a collision with Marty''s vehicle. Both drivers exchanged information and took photos of the accident scene, which included damages to the front driver and passenger side of Marty''s Delorean DMC-12 and the front driver''s side of Biff''s Volkswagen Bus. No injuries were reported.

  Marty has attached necessary documents, such as photos, a police report, and an estimate for repair costs, to his email. He requests prompt attention to the claim and is available at (916) 555-4385 or marty.mcfly@email.com for any additional information or documentation needed.`;

Your answers should not include any harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content. Please ensure that your responses are socially unbiased and positive in nature. If a question does not make any sense, or is not factually coherent, explain why instead of answering something not correct. If you don't know the answer to a question, please don't share false information."
