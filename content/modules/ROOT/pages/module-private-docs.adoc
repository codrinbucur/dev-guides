== Integrating AI into an Existing Application

Parasol Insurance is looking to not only build new apps but also integrate generative AI into their existing applications, such as their customer service representative tools used to respond to customer claim emails. In this exercise, you will:

* Dive into advanced application integration techniques for AI, exploring how to integrate AI into applications for Parasol's unique needs
* Learn how to ingest and utilize private documents securely
* Apply the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern to enhance AI model output
* Extend AI models with specialized tools and agents
* Understand the limitations of RAG and when to consider fine-tuning

This module will focus on *Building and Refining*.

IMPORTANT: If you've NOT already done the steps in accessing Red Hat Developer Hub and Red Hat Dev Spaces, please follow the instructions in the following sections. Otherwise, you can skip ahead to the *Implementing a Chatbot* section.

== Working in your Cloud-based Development Environment

https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces^] is a cloud-based development environment built on top of Kubernetes and containers. It offers a streamlined and secure way for developers to code, build, and test applications directly within the OpenShift ecosystem. You'll use the Dev Spaces to develop a new Generative AI feature (e.g.,`email generator`).

=== Using LangChain4j with Quarkus

You'll be building new features in this application, based on https://developers.redhat.com/products/quarkus/overview[Quarkus^] and the https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j[LangChain4j^] library. The https://quarkus.io/extensions/?search-regex=langchain[Quarkus LangChain4j extensions^] bridge the gap between your Quarkus application and LangChain4j, a library that allows interaction with various LLMs like OpenAI, Hugging Face, or Ollama. with the following key features and benefits:

* *Key Features*
** *Simplified LLM Integration*: The extension streamlines the process of incorporating LLMs into your application, saving development time and effort.
** *Declarative AI Services*: Define how you want to interact with the LLM using annotations or configuration files.
** *Embedding Support*: Integrates with document embedding stores like Redis, Chroma, or Infinispan to store and retrieve document context for the LLM.
** *Observability Integration*: Allows monitoring and logging of LLM interactions within your Quarkus application.

=== Understanding the application's codebase

This Quarkus application is a customer service processing tool that handles customer claim emails for Parasol insurance. The team has recently improved the application with a chatbot to interact with the agent and generate responses based on the email content. In the VS Code environment, navigate to the `app/src/main/java/org/parasol` directory, which contains the main capabilities of the application.

image::private-docs/quarkus_codebase.png[Quarkus codebase]

In the `app/src/main/java/org/parasol/ai/ClaimService.java` file, you'll find the main AI chatbot class that processes the customer claim emails with a `SystemMessage`, `UserMessage`, and chat method. The chat method processes the claim details and question, then generates a response based on the claim and references provided.

You can also explore the `app/src/main/resources/application.properties` file to review the application configuration, including the Quarkus configuration and the LangChain4j extension settings.

== Testing out the existing chatbot

Now that we've checked out the chatbot, let's test it:

. In the terminal within Dev Spaces, navigate to your project directory and run:
+
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw quarkus:dev
----

image::private-docs/quarkus_dev.png[Quarkus dev]

[start=2]
. Open a new browser tab and navigate to the Parasol application URL (https://x-{user}-x-{user}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}).

image::private-docs/parasol_ui.png[Parasol UI]

. Click on the chat icon in the bottom right corner to open the chat interface.

image::private-docs/chat_interface.png[Chat interface]

. In the chat interface, try asking the following questions about a specific claim:
* "What is the status of this claim?"
* "When was the incident reported?"
* "What is the claimed amount?"

image::private-docs/chatbot_questions.png[Chatbot questions]

You should notice that the chatbot can answer these questions based on the claim context we provided. Now, let's ask a more complex question that requires knowledge of Parasol's policies:

. Ask the chatbot: "Should this claim be approved based on Parasol's policies?"

You'll observe that the chatbot struggles with this question, as it doesn't have access to Parasol's specific policies. If only there was a way to automatically retrieve this information and provide it to the chatbot!

== Introduce & build RAG

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances language models by providing them with relevant information retrieved from a knowledge base. This is particularly useful when dealing with domain-specific knowledge or private data.

* When to use RAG vs fine-tuning (maybe covered at beginning)
* Now re-ask previous question and bot should be able to answer

== Build a tool/agent to notify the user by email an update to their claim

* Send email to user with pre-defined text that the claim status has changed to "being worked on".
* Reuse stuff from https://redhat-developer-demos.github.io/quarkus-tutorial/quarkus-tutorial/19_agents_tools.html

== Re-run chat asking to notify the user that their clain is being worked on

== Go to Dev UI to see email

== Conclusion

We hope you have enjoyed this module!
